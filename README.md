Background:
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In their most recent study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. 

The executive team requested tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study as well as a top-level summary of the study results.
